# MapReduce K-Means Clustering

## Description
This project implements a MapReduce framework from scratch to perform K-Means clustering on a given dataset in a distributed manner. Each component (master, mappers, reducers) runs as a separate process and communicates using gRPC.

## Components
1. **Master**: Manages the entire process, including splitting input data, invoking mappers, and reducers, handling failures, and compiling final centroids.
2. **Mappers**: Process input data chunks, compute nearest centroids for data points, and partition the data for reducers.
3. **Reducers**: Aggregate data points belonging to the same centroid, compute new centroids, and handle shuffle and sort operations.

## Prerequisites
- python3
- gRPC library (`grpcio` and `grpcio-tools`)
- numpy library (`numpy`)

Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools numpy
```

To build proto files:
```sh
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. master.proto
```
